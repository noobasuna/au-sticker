## Overview

Au-Sticker is a research project that explores the causal placement of adversarial stickers to mitigate emotion leakage in facial images. The project uses deep learning models and causal inference to strategically place stickers that challenge emotion recognition systems while maintaining image naturalness.


## Steps to Generate Adversarial Images

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/au-sticker.git
   cd au-sticker
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run the main script to generate adversarial images:

  ```bash
  python main.py
```

### Configuration

You can customize the following parameters:
- Image size
- Sticker types and sizes
- Model architecture
- Training parameters
- Output directories
